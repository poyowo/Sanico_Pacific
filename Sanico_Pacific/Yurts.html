                Each yurt has canvas walls, a wooden floor, a roof dome that can be opened, and a private deck.
            </dd>
            <dt><strong>How are the yurts furnished?</strong></dt>
            <dd>Each yurt is furnished with a gas fireplace, king-sized bed with down quilty, comfy couch, dining table
                and chairs, mini-fridge, microwave, and coffee maker.

            <dt><span class="special"><strong>What should I bring?</strong></dt></span>
            <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers of
                clothing.
                It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
